    Concurrency refers to the ability of a worker to handle multiple tasks at the same time.
    By default, Celery workers use a concurrency level of one, which means that each worker can only handle one task at a time.
    However, this can be increased to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

    Prefetching is the process of loading a batch of tasks into a workerâ€™s memory before they are actually executed.
    This can help to improve performance by reducing the time it takes to fetch new tasks from the broker.
